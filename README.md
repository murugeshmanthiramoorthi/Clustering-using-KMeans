# Clustering-using-KMeans

I have used a set of reviews from a reviews site and performed unsupervised-machine learning to cluster the reviews into relatable set of words. 

In order to determine the perfect number of cluster to be formed, elbow method is used. 

The resultant graph obtained from the elbow graph is shown below
